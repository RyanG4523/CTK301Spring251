		<p><a href="This is a link" target="blank"> This is a link</a> Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Bender, quit destroying the universe!</p>
		<p>I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Do a flip!</p>
		<p><a href="This is a link" target="blank"> This is a link</a>, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? When will that be? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?</p>
		<p><a href="This is a link" target="blank"> This is a link</a>. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack!  I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!</p>

		<h2>This is another H2</h2>
			<p class="f">The navigation link boxes are all the same width regardless of the amount of text inside. Make the nav link backgrounds change when you roll over them. Make sure all the text in the links changes color when you roll over them (even the link in the h1). THe main header and navigation have gradients in the background.</p>
            
            <p>Clicking the ISU main site in a new window/tab. All three of your pages should have the same format for the headers, navigation, and footer. This paragraph is justified, the others are not.</p>
